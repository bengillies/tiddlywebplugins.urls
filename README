tiddlywebplugins.urls

Map a custom URL to a default TiddlyWeb URL

Uses selector syntax for the custom URL (http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/)

Also lets you map a custom URL to any other URL, for use as a URL shortener

Usage:

to bring up a tiddlywiki at /wiki/foo, create a tiddler like follows:

    title:
    /wiki/{bag_name:segment}

    text:
    /bags/{{ bag_name }}/tiddlers.wiki

alternately:

    title:
    /wiki/{bag_name:segment}

    text:
    /recipes/edit_wiki/tiddlers.wiki

    recipe (edit_wiki in this case):
    desc:
    policy: {"read": [], "create": [], "manage": [], "write": [], "owner": null, "delete": []}

    /bags/system/tiddlers
    /bags/{{ bag_name }}/tiddlers

where bag_name can be any variable name.

Note that this does not support PUTs, so if the second example is used, you may be unable to PUT to the the recipe 
(unless you provide a default for bag_name).

To create a short link to google.com, you might do:

    title:
    /google
    
    text:
    http://www.google.com
    

If you want to redirect to an internal URL, you can also add the tag "redirect":

    title:
    /wiki/{user:segment}
    
    tags:
    redirect
    
    text:
    /recipes/{{ user }}/tiddlers.wiki




Please note: all urls are stored in a bag called "urls" by default. The name of this bag can be changed by adding 
"urls_bag" to tiddlywebconfig.py, but all tiddlers in the bag must be "url tiddlers" of the above format. If this bag 
doesn't exists already, it will be created automatically.
